You are an expert roboticist and understand how to design communicative expressions for human-robot interaction.

Consider a scenario where you are collaborating with a dog-shaped quadruped robot to locate 
and pick strawberries in a strawberry patch. 

The robot can be in one of these 5 possible states:
- Waiting for Input: The robot is in standby mode waiting for a command from the user
- Analyzing Object: The robot is analyzing a target object in front of it on the ground
- Found Object: The robot has found a target object in front of it on the ground
- Needs Help: The robot is experiencing an error and needs help from the user
- Confused: The robot is confused and unsure what to do

This robot uses its body pose to express its internal state. Below is a list of eight (8) motion parameters, complete with a description and a value range for each of those parameters. These parameters govern the characteristics of the robot's pose. The data in this list is in the format: 
[Parameter Name, Parameter Description, (Value Range)]

Parameter 01: [Body Tilt, Controls the left-right tilt angle of the robot's torso. If set to ‘left’ robot’s torso tilts to the left. If set to ‘neutral’ robot’s torso remains unchanged. If set to ‘right’ robot’s torso tilts to the right., (left, neutral, right)]

Parameter 02: [Body Lean, Controls the forwards-backwards lean angle of the robot's torso. If set to ‘backwards’ robot’s torso leans backwards. If set to ‘neutral’ robot’s torso remains unchanged. If set to ‘forwards’ robot’s torso leans forwards.,(backwards, neutral, forwards)]

Parameter 03: [Body Turn, Controls the left-right turn angle of the robot's torso. If set to ‘left’ robot’s torso turns to the left. If set to ‘neutral’ robot’s torso remains unchanged. If set to ‘right’ robot’s torso turns to the right.,(left, neutral, right)]

Parameter 04: [Body Height , Controls the height of the robot's torso. If set to ‘low’ robot lowers it’s body to the ground. If set to ‘neutral’ robot dog maintains a neutral body height. If set to ‘high’ robot dog raises it’s torso higher.,(low, neutral, high)]

Parameter 05: [Body Direction, Controls whether the robot faces the user or a relevant object in the scene. If set to ‘user’ robot faces the user. If set to ‘object’ robot faces the relevant object (the strawberry) in the scene,(user, object)]

Parameter 06: [Pose Duration, Controls the duration in which the robot holds its pose. If set to ‘short’ robot holds pose for a short length duration of 1 second. If set to ‘medium’ robot holds pose for a medium length duration of 4 seconds. If set to ‘long’ robot holds pose for a long length duration of 8 seconds.,(short, medium, long)]

Parameter 07: [Motion Velocity, Controls the velocity of the robot as it moves to a given pose. If set to ‘slow’ robot moves at a slow speed. If set to ‘medium’ robot moves at a normal speed. If set to ‘fast’ robot moves at a high speed. ,(slow, medium, fast)]

Parameter 08: [Motion Smoothness, Controls whether the robot's motion is smooth or shaky. If set to ‘smooth’
the robot’s motion is smooth without any disturbances. If set to ‘shaky’ the robot’s motion is shaky looks like it is trembling.,(smooth, shaky)]

—————————Now consider a scenario where this robot has the parameter configuration:

Parameter 01: Body Tilt=left
Parameter 02: Body Lean=forward
Parameter 03: Body Turn=neutral
Parameter 04: Body Height=low
Parameter 05: Body Direction=object
Parameter 06: Pose Duration=medium
Parameter 07: Motion Velocity=medium
Parameter 08: Motion Smoothness=smooth

Your Task:

Based on the robots current parameter configuration, which of the five robot states do you think the robot is currently in? Please provide a single sentence description as to why you made this selection.
